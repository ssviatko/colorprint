The color_print library replaces printf and fprintf(stderr, ...) with three new
functions:

color_err_printf(errnoflag, "format", ...)

This routine prints out errors to stderr, typically in RED although this can
change depending on the theme installed. The first argument is an integer,
either 0 or 1, depending on whether you want color_print to display the current
errno string after the error message. There is no need to append a \n to the
end of this format message as color_err_printf handles that automatically.

color_debug("format", ...)

This prints out debug messages, provided that debug flag is turned on when the
color_print library is initialized. This allows programs that use it to carry
a debug on/off flag that the user can set via an argument to make the
color_debug messages show, or be silent. Debug messages print in a lovely
diarrhea brown in all of the themes.

color_printf("format", ...)

This is the main color printing routine. Various escape sequences beginning
with a * character can be embedded in the format. They are as follows:

Theme-dependent colors:                     Default (green theme 0) color:

*a      Begin HEADING color                 Dark Green
*h      Begin HIGHLIGHT color               Light Green
*b      Begin BULLET color                  Yellow
*e      Begin ERROR color                   Bright Red
*d      Return to default terminal color    (default)

Other themes built in to the system: Blue (1), Red (2), Purple (3). By making
the theme a settable parameter in your program a user can choose a different
theme according to their questionable tastes.

color_print also supports 256 colors and full RGB colors on terminals that
support these modes. The Mac OS terminal supports 256 colors, while Windows
and Linux both support full RGB. The syntax for specifying these colors
is as follows:

*2[color]           Specify foreground color from 256 color pallette
*3[color]           Specify background color from 256 color pallette
*5[red,green,blue]  Specify RGB components of foreground color
*6[red,green,blue]  Specify RGB components of background color

To get the original 16 colors used on the traditional CGA, EGA, and VGA text
terminals, use colors 0-15 of the 256 color pallette.

Example: highlight a word in traditional VGA cyan: (color #6)

color_printf("I am highlighted in *2[6]cyan!!*d Isn't it pretty?\n");

Also, color_print supports 16 pre-defined colors that were originally used
on the Apple IIgs. They can be specified as follows:

*c[color]           Specify Apple IIgs foreground color
*g[color]           Specify Apple IIgs background color

The HTML codes for these colors are as follows (they are quite pretty):

0x000000 Black
0xdd0033 Deep Red
0x000099 Dark Blue
0xdd22dd Purple
0x007722 Dark Green
0x555555 Dark Gray
0x2222ff Medium Blue
0x66aaff Light Blue
0x885500 Brown
0xff6600 Orange
0xaaaaaa Light Gray
0xff9988 Pink
0x11dd00 Light Green
0xffff00 Yellow
0x44ff99 Aquamarine
0xffffff White
